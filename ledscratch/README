Presentation
============

The idea of this project was to be able to play with lights using a digital
scratch tool such as serato. In our case, we used a LED strip and a Teensy
to analyse the signal plus some electronics interfacing.

The stereo signal that we get from the turntable is a pair of 5mV peak to peak
sine waves, one of them is a quarter of period late to detect the direction.

To analyse it in the teensy, we saturate it to a squared wave of 5V-0V with
an op-amp in comparator mode (LM358).
Because of the vinyl noise, it needs to be filtered to remove the frequencies
above 8KHz and below 500Hz (at a normal speed, the frequency is 2000Hz).
This digital signal is then processed using the Encoder library of Arduino.


Utilization
===========

The Encoder library and some explanaitions can be found on the following page,
but it's already in the repository so don't download it:
  http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html
Here is how to use it:

# Go in the libraries folder of your arduino (adapt this line to your case):
cd /opt/arduino/libraries/

# ...and make a link (adapt this line too):
SKETCH_FOLDER=$HOME/sketchbook
ln -s $SKETCH_FOLDER/displaysolar/libraries/Encoder
