Welcome !

These projects are the result of the collaboration with Tangible Display and
Systema Solar.

The idea was to add some sound & light interactivity in concerts, to do so,
we used Arduinos (teensy), sensors and computers, more details are given
in each README of each project directory (but libraries is not a project).

Enjoy !
